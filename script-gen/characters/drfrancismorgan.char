flavour
"Those creatures â€• I haven't seen anything like that since..." He trails off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. "I may not be in the best shape, but I'll help with your investigation. Whatever it takes."

overview Dr. Francis Morgan gets a chance to save themselves before they die.
If Dr. Francis Morgan is attacked at night and would die due to this, they live and learn that they would have died. Then, if an evil player is executed on the next day, nothing happens. Otherwise, Dr. Francis Morgan dies the next night.
The executed evil player does not need to die for Dr. Francis Morgan to survive the next night.
If Dr. Francis Morgan is protected from death in any way besides their own ability, they do not wake to learn that they were attacked, and will not die due to their own ability in the next night (even if no evil player is executed).
Dr. Francis Morgan is unaffected by abilities that force them to learn false info.
Dr. Francis Morgan cannot die due to their own ability if they are drunk or poisoned, but they also do not protect themselves from death.
If Dr. Francis Morgan is drunk or poisoned, they may learn that they were attacked at night, even though they were not. If this happens, and they become sober & healthy the next night, they do not die due to their own ability, even if no evil player was executed.
Dr. Francis Morgan does not learn that they were attacked if they die.
If Dr. Francis Morgan is attacked multiple times during the same night, they survive but only learn once that they would have died.
If Dr. Francis Morgan would die during the day, their own ability does not protect them.
