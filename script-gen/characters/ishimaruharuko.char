"That 'Stranger' character... Peculiar role, is it not? For whatever reason, Mr. Engram would not allow me to change his outfit, not one bit. And that mask!" She scoffs. "Did you know, one time I found that actor - I don't even know his name! - I found him drawing a strange pattern behind the backdrop for the second act. You know the one, with the two suns. He gave me a terrible stare, and I daresay I jumped right off the stage and ran!"
