examples
Monterey Jack learnt a good player as their Hanif. They choose a good neighbour of Jeremiah Pierce, and learn evil.
The Assassin neighbours Jeremiah Pierce, and dies by execution. The Assassin is claiming to be the Nightwatchman. The Storyteller decides that they register as the good Nightwatchman to the Cannibal, so the Cannibal gains the Nightwatchman ability.
The Gambler neighbours Jeremiah Pierce. They gamble incorrectly, but Wilson Richards protects them. The Gambler registers as the Po to Wilson Richards, so they learn Po.
The Fang Gu attacks an Outsider who neighbours Jeremiah Pierce. Jeremiah Pierce cannot cause players to misregister to evil abilities, so the Outsider becomes an evil Fang Gu, and the original Fang Gu dies.

Whenever a good player's ability detects the character or alignment of one (or both) of Jeremiah Pierce's neighbours, choose which character and alignment they register as.
