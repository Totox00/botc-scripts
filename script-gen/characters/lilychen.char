The battlefield had been chosen for her, but it would serve. Striding to the center of the space, she turned and locked eyes with the first man she had seen. As she had expected, he did not flinch but instead increased his own stride. Another dozen assailants moved in from all directions, ready to pounce like a pack of wolves on a wounded buffalo. They had made an error, though â€• they were not the hunters but the pray.
